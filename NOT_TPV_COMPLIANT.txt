Due to bullshit that both the Emerald Team and Emerald pulled, this viewer is currently not TPV compliant.

Use of this client under the current version is a violation of the Second Life Third Party Viewer agreement.  Therefore:

*********************************************************************
* LOGGING INTO THE SECOND LIFE GRID IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THE MOMENT. *
*    YOU LOG INTO AGNI AT YOUR OWN RISK.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.     *
*********************************************************************

== Details ==

First of all, I've been permanently banned for things in the past (usually bullshit reasons, like cursing), 
which automatically invalidates the TPV agreement.  The other developers are not banned as far as I know, but 
I do not think they count.  I don't log into Second Life anymore (I usually use this in InWorldz anyway), 
but I still don't think that counts.  If you wish to ask the Lindens about this at any of the GlowSnobe meetings or whatever,
go right ahead.

In addition, although I have removed most traces of Emerald, there are a few shards left that I am working on removing.  
Emerald was a popular viewer up until the development team used it's popularity to launch a denial of service attack 
against a website they did not like.  They also routinely leaked users' private information without notification or permission.

Keep in mind that the updating process will be *very slow*, as I am currently embroiled in a horrendous 8-week university course from Hell.  

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
