Forked from Inertia, Ascent's goal is to "clean up" the code, removing "bad" features and limiting as necessary to provide a stable, powerful client with features for both content creators and general use that adheres to the Linden Labs Third Party Viewer Policy.

Since the initial fork to take in Inertia's useful asset browsing features, alpha skins on a Snowglobe base and other numerous attractive features, the code has been extensively modified to make sure that it is a legit Second Life client. Code from other Third Party Viewers has been merged extensively as well -- Including Emerald, Imprudence, and Nano. 

Far from being just a fork, we aim to aggregate useful features from all clients where content development is concerned, to provide builders, modders, programmers and all other creators in Second Life a powerful toolset to work their trade, without having to compromise their privacy or security by using TPVs such as Emerald.

If you don't trust us or the legitimacy of our code, please, take it upon yourself to download our source and take a look. We have nothing to hide, and we will never obfusticate our code with encryption or closed-source DLL bundling.
