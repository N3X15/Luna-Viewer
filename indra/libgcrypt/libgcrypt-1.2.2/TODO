What's left to do                                 -*- outline -*-

* Add more tests.  Even basic is very minimal.

* udiv-qrnbd.o should get build as *.lo [HPUX]

* Allow operation using RSA keys consisting of the OpenSSL list of
  parameters and allow for a third form where the private Exponent
  is not given (saves space).

* Add a warning to the manual, to check that libgcrypt actually has
  been compiled with thread support when used by a threaded
  application.

* write an autoconf test to check whether the linker supports a
  version script.

* Make use of the forthcoming visibility attribute.

* Add attributes to the MPI functions.

* Write tests for the progress function

* In case the ac interface will be more popular than the pk interface,
  the asymmetric ciphers could be changed for convenient interaction
  with the ac interface (i.e. by using ac's `data sets') and the pk
  interface could be changed to be a wrapper for the ac interface.

* HMAC won't work with sha-512 due to the different block size.  OTOH,
  I can imagine no cryptographic reason to use it.

* cipher/pubkey.c and pubkey implementaions.
  Don't rely on the secure memory based wiping function but add an
  extra wiping.
