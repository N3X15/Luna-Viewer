// LLWorldMipmap : Mipmap handling of all the tiles used to render the world at any resolution.
// This class provides a clean structured access to the hierarchy of tiles stored in the 
// Amazon S3 repository and abstracts its directory/file structure.
// The interface of this class though still assumes that the caller knows the general level/tiles
// structure (at least, that it exists...) but doesn't requite the caller to know the details of it.
// IOW, you need to know that rendering levels exists as well as grid coordinates for regions, 
// but you can ignore where those tiles are located, how to get them, etc...
// The class API gives you back LLPointer<LLViewerImage> per tile.

// See llworldmipmapview.cpp for the implementation of a class who knows how to render an LLWorldMipmap.

// Implementation notes:
// - On the S3 servers, the tiles are rendered in 2 flavors: Objects and Terrain.
// - For the moment, LLWorldMipmap implements access only to the Objects tiles.
