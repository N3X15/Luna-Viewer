	//in case it isn't obvious, the viewer only sets the asset id on a successful script save (of a full perm script), or in preproc on-cache
	//so this is only applicable to fully permissive scripts; which is just fine, since if it isn't full perm it isn't really useful as a include anyway.
	//in the event of a no-trans script (only less than full thats readable), the server sends null key, and we will set a random uuid. 
	//This uuid should be overwritten if they edit that script, whether with the real id or null key is irrelevant in this case.
	//theoretically, if the asset IDs were exposed for full perm scripts without downloading the script at least once, it would save unnecessary caching
	//as this isn't the case I'm not going to preserve this structure across logins.
