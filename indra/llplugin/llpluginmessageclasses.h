// Version strings for each plugin message class.  
// Backwards-compatible changes (i.e. changes which only add new messges) should increment the minor version (i.e. "1.0" -> "1.1").
// Non-backwards-compatible changes (which delete messages or change their semantics) should increment the major version (i.e. "1.1" -> "2.0").
// Plugins will supply the set of message classes they understand, with version numbers, as part of their init_response message.
// The contents and semantics of the base:init message must NEVER change in a non-backwards-compatible way, as a special case.
